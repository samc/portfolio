As a developer, and even in my day-to-day life, I strive for efficiency. But, in the reality of today's online world, being fast and responsive just doesn't cut it.
Being effective<strong> today</strong> requires a keen balance between<strong> optimization</strong> and<strong> aesthetics</strong>.</p></div><div class="header-content-body gap about-two"><div class="line-left"></div><p class="header body gap about-two">My love for programming started around late<strong> 2011</strong>, shortly after<strong> Minecraft</strong> had seen it's official release. I started tinkering with the game
purely out of curiosity, and to my surprise, I really enjoyed the challenge and creative process that came along with<strong> Java</strong> development. Over the years, I went onto work with some wonderful people, who would go onto become amazing friends and mentors.</p></div><div class="header-content-body gap about-three"><div class="line-left"></div><p class="header body gap about-three">As time progressed, and the Minecraft community moved on, I began looking for another platform to mirror my creative desires. I had messed around with
some web-based ideas before, but I had never fully immersed myself into the space - and man am I glad that I did.</p></div><div class="header-content-body gap about-four"><div class="line-left"></div><p class="header body gap about-four">The switch to web was daunting at first, but as I stuck with it, my love for the space grew - and I know now that it is where I belong. Other than programming, over
the years, I've come to love<strong> cooking</strong>,<strong> fitness</strong>, and<strong> fashion</strong>.</p></div></div></div></div>
